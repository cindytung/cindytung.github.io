      <div class=heading>Earth Engine Least-Cost Path Tracing</div>
      <p>
        During the summer of 2016, I had the opportunity to intern at Google and work with the
        <a href="https://earthengine.google.com/" target="_blank">Earth Engine</a> team to develop scripting tooks
        that would allow users to dynamically trace least-cost paths between different sources. Earth
        Engine is a platform that comtains multi-perabytes of data for developers to perform planetary-scale
        analysis. Some examples include the monitoring of <a href="http://www.globalforestwatch.org/" target="_blank">global
        forest cover changes</a> and extraordinary <a href="https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/" target="_blank" >timelapses</a>.
        Earth Engine also provides a <a href="https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/playground" target="_blank">code editor</a>,
        a web-based IDE for the Earth Engine JavaScript API.
        <br><br>
        The goal of my project was to develop new tools for the code editor and the Earth Engine JavaScript API to
        allow developers to use these tools to dynamically trace least-cost paths between different sources. The
        least-cost path is not determined by distance, but rather calculated by the "cost" of the terrain--or the
        difficulty to cross or build resources over it. An example use case (the one that developers
        actually requested and first prompted the initiation of this project!) is to be able to find the best
        path between sources to build a road. Many researchers and non-profits were interested in finding best ways
        to give secluded communities access to resources, and wanted to be able to find the best places to build roads between
        these communities and resources such as water, hospitals, food, and more.
        <br><br>
        A lot of the code that I wrote were to modify how the map tiles were rendered, received, and posted. Before
        this project, the Earth Engine code base had pulled the map tiles displayed on the code editor from the Maps API,
        which only displayed the tiles in JPG/PNG form. However, my project required the tiles to be rendered as floating
        array buffers (specifically Float64Array). This requried the manipulation of the calls to the Maps API in order
        to receive the tiles, and the manipulation of the received data in order to further calculate the shortest paths.
        Further integration of these now Float64Array formatted map tiles required changes to the EE API, and new front-end
        tools had to be developed for users to use the new API calls. This was the first front-end Javascript project I've worked on
        prior to that summer, and the first time I've had to consider the roles that UI/UX plays in web applications.
        <br><br>
        The process of this project required a lot of communication with the engineers on the team, since rendering Float64Array
        formatted map tiles would change how map tiles would be handled across all API calls. Drafts and proposals had to be
        modified over and over again, and there were several occasions throughout the summer where a lot of the code written
        had to be comepletely re-done. While these points in time would be fustrating and I felt like had caused setbacks on the progression
        of the project over and over again, in the end I was glad that I was able to work so closely with the other engineers on the team
        and had to consider conflicting opinions on how to complete the implementations. This project and opportunity gave me invaluable
        insight to the engineering process, and taught me the importance of communication, flawless project domuentation, and great
        project styling has on the end project. Summer 2016 was an opportunity to learn a plethora of technical industry skills, and while
        the end of the summer was dissapointing, I'm excited for the new challenges I'll be facing at Google again for Summer 2017!
