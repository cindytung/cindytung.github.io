      <div class="content">Hi! I'm a senior studying Computer Science at the
        University of California, Berkeley. During the summer of 2017, I worked
        on the Gmail team at Google as a Software Engineering Intern
        for two prelaunch features in Gmail and Inbox.
        In my free time, I like to indulge in my <a href="library.html">library</a>, take
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cindytungg/" target="_blank">photographs</a>,
        dabble in web design, and try new
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cindy_and_daniels_finsta/" target="_blank">food</a>
        places. I am particularly interested in back-end or full-stack
        engineering work, and am invested in improving the under-resourced and
        under-represented communities in the Bay Area with my work in
        <a href="pages/anova.html">Anova</a>. View my resume
